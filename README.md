## 📜 Executive Summary: The FDAA Revolution

The **Codex Existentiae** represents the culmination of 40+ peer-reviewed publications establishing time as a fractal, self-replicating structure through the **Fractal Density Activation Axiom (FDAA)**.

### 🌟 Core Validated Results

- **Universal fractal dimensions**: $D_t \approx 0.81$ (envelope), $D_{carrier} \approx 0.63$ (carrier)
- **Quantum Physics**: Room-temperature coherence via fractal synchronization ($E=1.72\times$, $\rho=1/3$)
- **Fluid Dynamics**: Global Navier-Stokes regularity via orthogonal dissipation axiom
- **Particle Physics**: Yang-Mills mass gap $\Delta = \Sigma_*\cdot\Lambda_{QCD}\cdot\mathcal{F}(D_{envelope})$
- **Neuroscience**: EEG coherence and consciousness dimension $D_t \approx 0.81$
- **Number Theory**: Prime distribution and Riemann hypothesis via triadic decomposition
- **Biology**: Genetic code optimality (64-codon system) and DNA replication timing
